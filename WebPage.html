        <h2>How cheese is made</h2>
        <p> Acid <span style="color:yellow">cheese</span> are made by adding acid to the milk to cause the proteins to coagulate.
             Fresh <span style="color:yellow">cheeses</span>, such as cream <span style="color:yellow">cheese</span> or <span style="color:yellow">queso</span> fresco, are made by direct acidification. 
             Most types of <span style="color:yellow">cheese</span>, such as cheddar or Swiss, use rennet (an enzyme) in addition to the starter cultures to coagulate the milk. </p>
